## Description
<p align="justify">
As the human walked down the dusty road, he could feel the tension in the air. It was as if the very atmosphere was charged with electricity, and he knew that something was about to happen. He quickened his pace, eager to reach his destination and get out of this strange, alien world. As he turned a corner, he saw them. The aliens. They were tall and slender, with skin the color of copper and eyes that glowed like fire. They stood in a line across the road, blocking his way. The human's heart pounded in his chest as he reached for his weapon. He knew that he was vastly outnumbered, but he was not going to give up without a fight. He would not let these creatures take him without a struggle. The aliens began to move towards him, their eyes fixed on his every move. The human took a deep breath and aimed his weapon. He squeezed the trigger and a burst of energy shot out, hitting one of the aliens square in the chest. The alien cried out in pain and fell to the ground, writhing in agony. The other aliens hesitated for a moment, then redoubled their efforts. They surrounded the human, their weapons drawn and ready to fire. The human fought with all his might, but it was a losing battle. The aliens were too strong and too fast. He could feel his strength beginning to flag, and he knew that he was about to lose the fight. But just as the aliens were about to deliver the final blow, a loud siren blared through the air. The aliens stopped in their tracks and looked up in alarm. A group of human soldiers had arrived, ready to take on the aliens and defend their planet. The human grinned in relief as he watched the aliens retreat. He knew that it would not be the last time that he would face them, but he was ready for the next battle. He would not let these creatures defeat him. He was a fighter, and he would fight to the very end to protect his home and his people.

In the beginning, the user must validate an ID; if the user has doubts once the user approaches an NPC, the NPC comes forward and asks whether help is needed. And the user has the option to accept or reject. If the user asks for help, a full explanation about how to validate the ID or the user could ask about each step.
Another NPC who is sitting on the chair explains what has happened. This helps the user to understand the story behind the scenes and could help the understand the current situation and environment. Also, there are two NPCs discussing the work once the user approaches one of the NPCs instructs the user to go to the High-Security area.
As the user approaches the door of the High-Security area NPC sitting on the chair asks whether he needs to update the ID for permission to enter the High-Security area and instructs what to do. Apart from that once the user is in the high-security area, the dialogue will be between the NPC standing and the NPC will instruct what to do. The NPC explains what to do to enter the high-security area.

To enter the High-Security area user must validate the ID at different stages. Some NPC responds to the user so that the user can understand what to do next. People are discussing what are all the works that they want to do and discuss different situations. There are security guards, one inside and one outside, walking around using NavMesh systems.

The story thread is about the war between humans and aliens. The player is in a space station where the decisions of the attack are taking place and the live status of the universe is shown. Since the player enters the ship for the first time, the player must validate the ID with the use of ID validation equipment. The ID must validate separately for the normal door and security door.
